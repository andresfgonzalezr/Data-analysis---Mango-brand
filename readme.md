Project Explanation

Using the dataset taken from the mango website analize the behavior of the price and the stock from the brand across the diferent categories using real data, python and dependencies for data wrangling as pandas. Answering some questions related to the products in the brand that analize the price, SKU (stock keeping unit), some correlation analysis and product analysis, the questions were:

1. What is the distribution of product prices across different categories? This could include examining averages, medians, ranges, and variances to understand how product pricing varies among categories.
2. Are there any patterns or trends in how SKUs are assigned to different categories or price ranges? This could help understand the inventory and stocking strategy.
3. Is there a correlation between product price and the number of images a product has? This could help understand if more visual content is associated with higher-priced items.
4. How many products are for woman? How many for men?
